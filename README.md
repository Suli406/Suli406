Hi, I'm Sulaiman!

A musician first, aspiring data analyst second.

What I’m Learning

I'm diving into various technologies related to data, including:
- SQL: For database management and querying.
- Python: To analyze and visualize data.

My Goals

This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase my progress and projects. 

Collaboration

If you're looking to simplify programming concepts, I’d be happy to reciprocate by breaking down music theory for you. Let’s learn from each other!

Feel free to check out my projects and contribute!
